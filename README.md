# PlateWatcher

A simple nutrition app for tracking servings throughout days, weeks, or months.\
This is basically an experiment to learn about app development using Xcode and Swift.

### Current status
- Goals can be set to track different nutrition items
- The app provides a set of images to help identify items. In the future, a feature to allow uploading user images will be added.
- The chart view currently only shows a default set of values as an example display. This will be updated to show the relevant information.
- The settings view represents different user defined settings that will modify the user experience. However, the data save period setting has not yet been implemented.
- The app is available in English, Japanese, and Italian. However, all the translations were performed personally, so reporting any translation errors would be appreciated.
